Hello! I am a first year PhD student in Computer Science at Rice University, working under [Dr. Todd Treangen](treangenlab.com). 

I recently got my BS in Computer Science at Case Western Reserve University, and also previously spent ~6 months at the Universidade de Vigo in Spain working under [Dr. David Posada](posadalab.com). 

## Research Interests

I am working on developing algorithms and software tools for efficient and large scale analyses of viral sequences from (meta)genomic data. 

Application areas (current and future) include pathogen monitoring, microbiome analyses, viral transmission studies, intra-host variation, and zoonosis prediction, among others. Developing software that has applied use cases is a fundamental principle in my current and future work.

I also am generally interested in genetics, both microbial and human, and the impacts on human health.
